# Child_Safety_App
The parental control solution aims to provide a comprehensive and effective tool for parents to manage their children's online activity and ensure their safety. The solution will allow parents to customize their rules and set different levels of access and control for each child based on their age and maturity. It will offer features such as website blocking, time management, content filtering, and activity monitoring. This means that
parents will be able to block certain websites or apps, set time limits for screen time, filter inappropriate content, and receive real-time alerts and notifications about their children's online activity.
